These aren't just any lunch containers; they're my ticket to a healthier, happier, and  - way -  less stressful week.  Each one holds a delicious serving of teriyaki chicken, fluffy white rice, vibrant roasted carrots and peppers, and a generous helping of broccoli.  It's a flavor explosion in every bite – and the best part?  I made them all in advance!\n> \n> My meal prep journey wasn't always this picture-perfect.  For years, I struggled with inconsistent lunches, often resorting to unhealthy takeout or skipping meals entirely.  The thought of spending a Sunday prepping meals felt overwhelming.  But, after a particularly chaotic week of rushed lunches and late-night hunger pangs, I decided to give meal prepping a try.\n> \n> It started small.  I'd prep just one or two meals on Sunday. Then, as I saw the benefits – saved time, money, and a significant improvement in my energy levels – I gradually increased the number of meals I prepped.\n> \n> The key for me was finding simple, versatile recipes like this teriyaki chicken and veggie bowl.  It's easy to adjust portion sizes, and the ingredients are easily swappable.  Now, Sunday evenings are my “me time” dedicated to prepping my meals. It's become a relaxing ritual, not a chore.\n> \n> So, if you’re on the fence about meal prepping, I urge you to take the plunge.  Start small, find recipes you enjoy, and watch as it transforms your week from chaotic to calm and your lunch break from stressful to satisfying!\n"
